翻译：当明天变成了今天成为了昨天，最后成为记忆里不再重要的某一天，我们突然发现自己在不 知不觉中已被时间推着向前走，这不是静止火车里，与相邻列车交错时，仿佛自己在前进的错觉，而是我们真实的在成长，在这件事里成了另一个自己。出自：《单身公寓》
4、But through it all the key for me has been bravery and the deep-down knowledge that I am better than everyone else.翻译：但自始至终，支持我走下去最大动力是勇气。以及在内心深处我坚信：我比任何人都强。出自：《破产姐妹》

6、I dreamed a dream in time gone by, when hope was high and life worth living. I dreamed that love would never die. I dreamed that God would be forgiving. Then I was young and unafraid. And dreams were made and used and wasted. There was no ransom to be paid, no song unsung, no wine untasted. But the tigers come at night with their voices soft as thunder. As they tear your hope apart, as they turn your dream to shame.
翻译：曾几何时，我流连梦境，心比天高，人生充满希望。我梦见爱情永不消逝。我梦见上帝慈爱宽恕。那时我多么年轻，多么无畏。随心梦想，从不设防。不必付出什么代价，无歌不唱，无酒不尝。然而猛兽在黑夜来袭，如晴天霹雳轰然炸响。活生生撕碎了希望，把美梦全变成懊悔。出自：《悲惨世界》7、We shall always save a place for ourselves, only for ourselves. And then begin to love. Have no idea of what it is, who he is, how to love or how long it will be. Just wait for one love. Maybe no one will come out, but this kind of waiting is the love itself.
翻译：在自己面前，应该一直留在一个地方，独自留在那里。然后去爱。不知道是什么，不知道是谁，不知道如何去爱，也不知道可以爱多久。只是等待一次爱情，也许永远都没有人。可是，这种等待，就是爱情本身。出自：《冷山》
8、Love means never having to say you’re sorry.
翻译：爱就是永远不必说对不起。出自《爱情的故事》
9、I would rather share one lifetime with you than face all the ages of this world alone.
翻译：我宁愿和你共度凡人短暂的一生，也不愿一个人看尽这世界的沧海桑田。出自：《魔戒》10、I will return. I will find you. Love you. Marry you. And live without shame.翻译：我要回去，找到你，爱你，和你结婚，毫无羞耻地去生活。
